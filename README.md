# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Digital-Image-Processing

The plant disease detection system with efficient image segmentation and feature extraction algorithms and statistical models.

- We added improvements to the original proposal analysing image morphology and different color spaces. See *shadow_removal_v5* to get a step-by-step of the image processing and explore the classification results in da_and_md/classification folder;

- The files finished with *_v2* corresponds to the original paper, while with *_v5*, our alternative proposal. We reached the best results using images from corn leaves;

*Possibilities we explored*

- Alternative ways to smooth images;

- Shadow removal of images to get precise features from the dataset;

- Erosion and dilation to deal with image gaps;
